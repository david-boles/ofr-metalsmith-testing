## Build Process

| Build Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Initialize Metadata | Load Metalsmith metadata from `config.yml` (which should contain `bundles`, `productionBaseURL`, `developmentBaseURL`, and `developmentPort`). Also, set `metadata.devBuild` and `metadata.baseURL` depending on whether this is a development build. |
| Validate Bundles | Remove any files that are not part of a bundles specified in `metadata.bundles` and exit if no files belong to a specified bundle. |
| Metafiles | Using `metalsmith-metafiles`, put any data specified in `<path>.meta.yml` files into corresponding `<path>` files and delete the `<path>.meta.yml` files. If a corresponding `<path>` file for a `<path>.meta.yml` file does not exist, error. |
| Override Files | Iterate through the files in bundle order. If the file specifes a `override` key with a path that is within a bundle that has already been iterated through or is the current bundle, set `files[path]` to the file with an additional `overrideOriginalPath` value and an `overriden` array containing the overriden versions of the files in most original-first (lastest to be overriden-last) order. If the file specifes a `override` key with a path that is within a bundle that is yet to be iterated through, or is not specified, error.
| Clean Types | If set, downcase every file's `type`. If `type` is set but not included in the list below, error. If `type` is unset, set to `undefined`. |
| Set Output Paths | `contentOutputPath`, `pageOutputPath`, and `pageURLPath` are set for every file based on the table below. |
| Index Terms | Iterate through files with `type` set to `term` in bundle order. Create a `metadata.terms` object containing an entry for the downcased `termName` attribute if set and entries for every downcased string contained in `termAliases` if set all of which point to the file's path. If both `termName` and `termAliases` are unset, warn to console. If `metadata.terms.<term>` is overriden, log to console and suggest overriding files instead.
| Render Files | Iterate through files in bundle order, rendering pages with nunjucks and copying over content. Warn to console if an output file is overriden. The nunjucks environment loads files from metalsmith and contains the global `site`, which contains metalsmith's metadata and files under `metadata` and `files` |

## Supported Resource Types

| Name | Resource Type | Description | Build Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Undefined | `undefined` | This is the type given to any file that does not specify a type. | `pageOutputPath` and `pageURLPath` are unset if set. If unset, `contentOutputPath` is set to source path (after overrides). File contents are rendered to `contentOutputPath` without modification unless `noOutput` evaluates to `true`. |
| Page | `page` | A simple, static page on the site. Not recommended for pretty much anything except some stuff in the `core` bundle. | `contentOutputPath` is unset if set. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. The contents are rendered with nunjucks to `pageOutputPath`. |
| Index | `index` | An ordered navigation page to access other resources. | `contentOutputPath` is unset if set. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. The contents are rendered with nunjucks to `pageOutputPath`. |
| Document | `document` | A page of hierarchically organized content sections. | `contentOutputPath` is unset if set. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. The contents are rendered with nunjucks to `pageOutputPath`. |
| Term | `term` | Jargon. Description page can be linked to from other content (with a tooltip) easily. | `contentOutputPath` is unset if set. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. The contents are rendered with nunjucks to `pageOutputPath`. |
| Image | `image` | An image, with an accompanying page to display it and give information about it. | If unset, `contentOutputPath` is set to the file's path. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. File contents are rendered to `contentOutputPath` without modification and `core/image.njk` is rendered to `pageOutputPath`. |
| Video | `video` | A video, with an accompanying page to display it and give information about it. | If unset, `contentOutputPath` is set to the file's path. If unset, `pageURLPath` is set to the file's path with the last file extension removed (if there is one to remove). If unset, `pageOutputPath` is set to `pageURLPath` followed by `.html`. File contents are rendered to `contentOutputPath` without modification and `core/video.njk` is rendered to `pageOutputPath`. |
